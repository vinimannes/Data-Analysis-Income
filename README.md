Data Analysis Python

This code generates a fake table of 1000 lines using the Faker library, creates a pandas dataframe from the data, displays summary statistics, visualizes the distribution and relationship between variables, fits a linear regression model, and calculates the correlation matrix of the data. My code uses popular libraries like: pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, and scikit-learn for machine learning.
